Couple things to note about this program since this program was ment to be used by just me and my friends
1. The ip is hard coded because I was the only one plannin on using it(if you want to use the program use your public ip and port forward)
2. The program is windows only but thats only becasue of the timer class or something so replace that and it can be cross platform i think
3. ISSERVER, set this to 1 and thats your copy of the program, set it to 0 then its the copy u give to friends
4. The program can be a little rough on your internet, so you might want to adjust MAXUPLOADSPEED

How this program works?
step 1: read in some of file from memory
step 2: send a whole bunch of packets to the other person, sometimes get a message of what packets were dropped and re send thoughs
step 3: wait for the other person to say they got all the packets, and send any packets they ask for
repeat steps 1-3 until entire file is sent

reciever
step 1: listen for packets, save data in memory
step 2: send what packets are missing
step 3: send that all packets are recieved
step 4: write to file go back to step 1
